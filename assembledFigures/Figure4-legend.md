**Figure 4.  Supervised Classification Using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Logistic Regression Reveals that the Fecal Microbiota can be Used to Discriminate Pre- and Post-Samples Across 16S rRNA Datasets.** (A) The heatmap shows the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) from cross validations within each study (yellow boxes along diagonal) and study-to-study model transfer (external-validations off-diagonal). The last column shows the average AUROC for study-to-study predictions. (B) White bar plots show the AURC for a model trained on data from a single study predicting the test study on the X-axis. The bar height represents the average AURC for the 3 classifiers and the error bar represents the standard deviation. The grey bar plots show the AURC for a model trained on all studies but one (LOSO validation).
