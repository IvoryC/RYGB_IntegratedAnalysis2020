**Figure 5. Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is Associated with Colonization of Opportunistic Pathogens in the Gut.** Boxplot shows the log~10~ normalized count of opportunistic pathogens (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Klebsiella oxytoca_, _Enterococcus faecalis_, _Enterobacter cloacae complex sp_, _Enterobacter cloacae_, _Enterococcus faecium_, and _Clostridium perfringens_) at pre- and post- surgery from the Kraken2- taxonomically classified metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene sequences. Mixed linear models were used to compare the log10 normalized count of opportunistic pathogens between different timepoints. Significant differences at FDR 5% are shown.
