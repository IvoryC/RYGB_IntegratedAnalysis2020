**Figure 5. Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is Associated with Colonization of Opportunistic Pathogens in the Gut.**  Boxplot shows the log~10~ normalized count of opportunistic pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae complex sp, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecium, and Clostridium perfringen) at pre- and post- surgery from the Kraken2- taxonomically classified metagenomic and 16S rRNA sequences. Mixed linear models were used to compare the log~10~ normalized count of opportunistic pathogens between different timepoints. Significant differences at FDR 5% are shown.
