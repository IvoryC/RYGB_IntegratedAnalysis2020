**Figure 2. Several Taxa at the Genus Level were Increased or Decreased Consistently Across Datasets.**  A hierarchical clustering heatmap was performed on the Euclidian distances of log~10~ p-values from the mixed linear models with timepoint as a fixed effect and patient ID as a random effect. Red indicates taxa were increased after surgery, while blue indicates taxa were decreased after surgery compared to baseline.
