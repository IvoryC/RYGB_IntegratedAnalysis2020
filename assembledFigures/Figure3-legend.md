**Figure 3. A Consistent Signature of Metabolic Pathways in Addition to Microbiota Composition is Associated with Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery Across Metagenomic Studies.** (A-B) log~10~ p-value versus log~10~ p-value plots are generated using the unadjusted p-values from mixed linear models comparing log~10~ normalized count of species at each timepoint post-surgery to baseline. The upper right-quadrant and lower left-quadrant show species that were enhanced and decreased, respectively, in two different studies (A) or at two different timepoints within a study (B). Spearman rank-order correlation was used to test the consistency of changes in species after RYGB between studies or within studies. All pairwise comparisons between and within studies are shown in Supplementary Figure 5. (C) Boxplots show the correlation coefficients from Spearman rank-order correlations between and within studies. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the correlation coefficients (* adjusted p < 0.05). (D-F). Similar plots to (A-C) are generated but for metabolic pathways profiled by the HUMAnN2 pipeline.
